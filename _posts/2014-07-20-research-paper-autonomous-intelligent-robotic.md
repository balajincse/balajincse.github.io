### Abstract
This paper presents the platform for autonomous vehicle architecture, controls of the system and vehicle navigation optimization. The basic approach is to develop an intelligent agent to create a safety journey and also creating the future transportation. The agent also includes many facilities like virtual reality will help the user to learn driving, augment reality technology is used to fast controlling in manual driving, especially for race drivers to creating lap timing and trainee as a race driver.

### Responsibilities
   1. Responsibilities for Research workflow Management and creating & Developing the appropriate Design and implementation of Simulation for the Autonomous Vehicle in C Sharp Language.  
   2. Create the Future Transportation with fully autonomous navigation vehicle and self-learning mechanism. Adding Mobility service and cloud service to accessing and use the vehicle more efficiently.
   3. Organizing and coordinating the research and development. 

### Environment
Autonomous, LIDAR, Stereo Camera, Kalman filter, Hybrid A-Star Search, Intelligent robotic and system, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Automatic Car.
