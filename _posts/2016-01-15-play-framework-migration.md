### Project Description
We support our partners to migrating their product into the IBM Bluemix Cloud. For my responsibility I created MVC web application using Play Framework backend as a Postgresql Database as for client requirement. Also, I migrated this third part framework application into Bluemix successfully. We presented the demo to our client and work with the client to migrating the original product into the IBM Bluemix Cloud.    

### Responsibilities
   1. Responsibilities to develop a web application with backend as Postgresql database connectivity using Play Framework. 
   2. Using $dist Command (Hint: The dist task builds a binary version of your application that you can deploy to a server without any dependency on SBT or Activator, the only thing the server needs is a Java installation.) in play consoles to get ready deploying application in .zip format.
   3. After testing the application in localhost ready to create config.yml file for Bluemix Cloud.
   4. Once the config.yml file contains the application name, service address, postgresql instance service name and .zip source address which helps the Bluemix Cloud Foundry to rest of the provisioning and start the development into the Cloud.
   5. Resolving the connecting port issues and make sure all went successfully.
   6. Organizing and coordinating the project development. 


### Environment 
Play Framework, IBM Bluemix, Java, Postgresql, MVC.
